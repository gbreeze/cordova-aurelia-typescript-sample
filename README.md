# cordova, aurelia, typescript sample

This should be a cordova sample app for typescript, aurelia and requirejs.

But at the moment I need your help to get this Visual-Studio project to work. At the moment I get an error like:
`Unhandled promise rejection TypeError: Cannot read property '__useDefault' of undefined`

It would be great if you can help me, thanks.
